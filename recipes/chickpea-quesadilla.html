        <p class="Intro">
            Inspired by these ultra-decadent Buffalo Chickpea Quesadillas but with a sweet potato twist, you won’t believe these spicy, cheesy quesadillas are cheese-free! If you’re gluten-free, you can use a gluten-free tortilla. And for the hot sauce, I used Frank’s Xtra hot sauce (you can use Frank’s original sauce). And if you can’t find Frank’s hot sauce, use Cholula, Tabasco, or another hot sauce of your preference.

                <p>
                    Combine the sweet potato flesh, chickpeas, nutritional yeast, and hot sauce in a food processor. Blend until all of the ingredients are well combined into a thick puree, similar to the texture of a thick hummus.    
                </p>
                 </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spread the filling evenly onto 3 extra-large or 4 large tortillas, depending on how much filling you want in each one. Top with the remaining tortillas and push together gently.
                </p>
            </li>

                    Lightly grease a large 12-inch skillet with a bit of oil or nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium. Once the skillet is hot, add one prepared quesadilla. Then place a smaller skillet on top of the quesadilla so that it presses down on the quesadilla. The weight helps form a nice crispy exterior. Cook the quesadillas for 3 minutes, or until golden brown on one side, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes, or until both sides are crispy and nicely browned. Repeat with the remaining quesadillas.
